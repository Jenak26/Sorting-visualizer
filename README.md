# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to help understand how different sorting algorithms work through real time animations, comparisons, and swaps.

This project visually demonstrates algorithm behavior, time complexity differences, and performance comparisons using an intuitive and beginner friendly interface.
